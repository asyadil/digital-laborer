      What worked for me: one small experiment for 14 days, track, then adjust.
      - pick one approach
      - measure a basic outcome
      - improve one part at a time
      The “boring” routine wins long-term.

      Quick checklist I use before posting:
      - Is it specific to this community?
      - Is there a replicable step?
      - Did I add one data point (time saved, $ saved, clicks)?
      If yes, I post. If not, I trim fluff and keep it lean.

      I treat every side-hustle test like a mini sprint:
      1) Define a 30-minute daily action
      2) Track for 10 days
      3) Kill or double-down
      Keeps me honest and avoids chasing shiny objects.

      Sharing metrics because they helped me decide:
      - Time spent/day: {{time_spent|default("20-30m")}}
      - Cost: {{cost|default("$0-10")}}
      - Result: {{result|default("first 3 signups")}}
      If you track these three, you’ll know within 2 weeks if it’s worth it.

      Friendly caution: most bans come from posting too fast or too promotional.
      Pace it (1-2 comments/day), add one personal detail, and avoid stacked links.
      Works better and keeps accounts healthy.

      What clicked: consistent posting, 1 helpful link max, replying to every comment with context.

      Do:
      - Post after reading top 5 threads to match tone
      - Add 1 concrete step + 1 personal detail
      - Leave room for questions
      Don’t:
      - Drop multiple links

      I always check 3 things before posting here:

      3) Tone of top comments

      Weekend posts with one data point (“saved $12” or “12 clicks”) worked best.
